# HD-560S-Crystal-Clear

## This configuration file is made for [Easy Effects](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects)

The settings were made for the **Sennheiser HD 560S**. 

Though, while usable with other headphones, I can not guarantee the quality of the settings.

Also recommended for **Sony WH-1000XM5**.

## Installation

Place the configuration file into the following folder:
`com.github.wwmm.easyeffects/config/easyeffects/output`

Note: When using flatpak the location of the application is most likely in `~/.var/app/`.

If you are not running Easyeffects through flatpak than replace the `com.github.wwmm.easyeffects` accordingly.

Then simply select the preset in the top left corner of the application and enjoy (and maybe tweak to your liking).

## Info

My personal configuration for EasyEffects. Made for music listening.

**Turn off reverberation for daily usage.**
